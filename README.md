Dynamically vs Statically typed languages

Weakly vs Strongly typed languages

Make a matrix of the above with your favorite languages. For example:

| Facet                    | Java                        | Perl                       | Elm                  | Ambrosia |
| ---                      | ----                        | ---                        | ---                  | --- |
| Compiled / Interpreted   | Compiled                    | Interpreted                | Compile to JS        | Both (compiled for production use) |
| Dynamic / Static         | Static to the point of ruin | Dynamic                    | Static, oh so static | Static |
| Weak / Strong typing     | Strong but droopy           | Flexible                   | Strong, oh so strong | Strong |
| Power of typing systems  | Shit                        | worse than Shit but clever | Pretty OK            | The Best |
